# System Audit Script: Roles and Virtualization Detection

This PowerShell script is designed to audit a system and determine:
- Whether the system is a **server** or **workstation**.
- The **installed roles** on server systems.
- Whether the system is **physical** or running in a **virtual machine** (VM) such as VMware or Hyper-V.
- Integrates with **RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management)** tools to set variables for further automation or reporting.
